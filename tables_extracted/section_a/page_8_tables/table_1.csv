Lending","Risk and 
Opportunity","OPPORTUNITIES
•	
Increased due diligence on 
the loan portfolio as regards 
Environmental & Social (E&S) 
risks. 
•	
See opportunities to build the 
green rated housing portfolio 
and encourage energy efficient 
homes. MoU signed with the 
Indian Green Building Council 
(IGBC) to promote smart, green 
buildings.
•	 Approximately, two-thirds of 
the lease rental discounting 
(LRDs) portfolio had green 
ratings. These entail Grade 
A commercial property. The 
demand for such buildings 
comes largely from companies 
in the services sector or 
multinational companies 
seeking to widen their footprint 
in India. The added benefit is 
that overseas companies bring 
in large investments which 
helps increase foreign exchange 
reserves as well as helps create 
a large number of jobs in the 
country.   
•	
Increased efforts through 
sensitisation of employees, 
customers and other 
stakeholders so as to 
endeavour to reduce the 
Corporation’s overall carbon 
footprint.  
•	 Greater disclosures on E&S may 
help increase access to larger 
pools of green financing at 
commercially favourable terms.
RISKS
•	
Reputational risks in case the 
Corporation is unable to meet 
stakeholder expectations 
on climate related financial 
disclosures.","•

have been put in 
place for various 
components 
of the lending 
portfolio. 
•	
To mitigate risks 
arising from 
climate change, 
the Corporation 
encourages 
homeowners 
to take home 
insurance to 
guard against 
risks of rising sea 
levels, floods, 
forest fires, 
natural hazards.
•	
Enhanced due 
diligence and 
monitoring of 
E&S risks on 
certain loans. 
•	
Recognising 
opportunities to 
increase energy 
efficiency across 
the organisation 
which will 
bring in cost 
efficiencies over 
the longer term.
•	
The Corporation’s 
ESG disclosures 
imbibe a 
combination 
of statutory 
and voluntary 
reporting 
initiatives.
•	
The Corporation 
is a supporter of 
the Task Force 
on Climate-
Related Financial 
Disclosures (TCFD).","Positive: 
Scope to build

portfolio 
and access 
greater pools 
of green 
funding.
Negative: 
Climate risk 
may entail 
physical risks 
i.e. damage 
to the 
Corporation’s 
physical 
assets in case 
of climate 
related 
disasters. 
There could 
be transition 
risks i.e. 
increased 
expenses in 
transiting 
towards 
meeting new 
environmental 
related 
standards."
