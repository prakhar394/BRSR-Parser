Details of remuneration/salary/wages, in the following format: 
 
The Bank’s remuneration practices are underpinned by principles of meritocracy and fairness. The 
remuneration system strives to maintain the ability to attract, retain, reward and motivate talent in 
order  to  enable  the  Bank  to  attain  its  strategic  objectives  within  the  increasingly  competitive 
context in which it operates. The Bank’s pay-for-performance approach strives to ensure that both 
internal and external equity are in line with the emerging market trends. The Bank has formulated 
and adopted a Remuneration Policy for Non-Executive Chairman and Non-Executive Directors of 
the Bank which provides guidelines for payment of remuneration to the Non-Executive Chairman 
and Non-Executive Directors of the Bank. During fiscal 2022, the said policy was amended in line 
with RBI circular on Corporate Governance in Banks - Appointment of Directors and Constitution 
of Committees of the Board dated 26 April, 2021. The Bank has also formulated a Remuneration 
Policy  for  MD  &  CEO,  Whole-Time  Directors,  Material Risk  Takers,  Control  Function  Staff  and 
other employees of the Bank, in terms of the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013, SEBI Listing 
Regulations and Guidelines on Compensation of Whole-Time Directors / Chief Executive Officers 
/ Material Risk Takers and Control Function staff, issued by the RBI on 4 November, 2019. This 
Remuneration Policy inter alia contains guidelines relating to compensation structure consisting of 
fixed  pay,  variable  pay,  employee  stock  options,  compensation  revision  cycle  and  framework 
regarding  malus  /  clawback.  During  fiscal  2022,  the  aspects  relating  to  malus  /  clawback  as 
contained in the said policy were amended. The above policies are available on the website of the
